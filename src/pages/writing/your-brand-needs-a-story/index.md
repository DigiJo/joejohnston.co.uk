Around 1 year ago I posted a vlog on LinkedIn detailing the importance of communicating benefits over features. It was a popular video, from my perspective, with over 4000 views - go me! ðŸŽ‰ 

The content of which I preached in this video, has since evolved. Features still tell, and benefits still sell, but that's not enough anymore. 

I'm going to take it one step further today:

> Features tell, benefits sell, stories resell!

As marketeers, we have an incredible thirst for leads ðŸ“ž. It's sadly how we are often assessed and sometimes remunerated.  

When I was a young, enthusiastic marketeer, **all I cared about were numbers on an excel sheet.** This lead to an inevitable increase in 'mis-marketing' and soul selling.

We will adapt to whoever the prospect wants us to be, forgetting our own identity and the company's. This leads to problems down the line; tough communication, high expectations, additional support queries.

> It's impossible to be everyone to everyone; it's better to be someone to someone.**

##So how do you be someone to someone?

Telling a story gives you identity. It tells the world, 'this is who I am, this is my journey, come join me'. It defines who you are; you are someone, not everyone.

If your story resonates with your target market, attracting loyal followers and customers is easier. 

You might find the quantity of leads dropping, but the quality will improve. You are now targeting followers and not leads.

When you attract these new loyal customers, communicating with them will be easier. They will understand and relate to you better. 

You don't have to be someone your not, just continue being who you are - they're already bought into that, give them more. You are now someone to someone.

##So how do I tell a story?

Why does your business exist? The answer to this question is your story. 

It's that simple, but to explain the why part of that equation, here is a video by Simon Sinek:

##Example of story telling

Toms is a shoe manufactuerer founded by Blake Mycoskie.

Blake was travelling Argentina in 2006 and was astonished to witness thousands of children growing up without shoes. He decided there and then, he needed to help them, so he created Toms.

*â€œWith every product you purchase, Toms will help a person in need â€œ.*

Blake shared the story of Toms to the world. Unique from other shoe manufacturers, it resonated with millions of consumers around the world.

Blake has developed the Toms' story, and they now provide help with water, safe birth, and eye sight.

Consumers buy the Toms story, and the people who buy the story, follow the company, its vision, and its future.

##Tell the world your story
When designing your next website, organising your next campaign, defining your company's vision, think about your brand's story and tell it. Once you have the story, sell, hire and connect with people who believe in it.
